![Build](https://github.com/volcengine/tosfs/workflows/CI/badge.svg)


TOSFS builds on [Volcengine TOS Python SDK](https://github.com/volcengine/ve-tos-python-sdk) to provide a convenient Python filesystem interface for [TOS（Tinder Object Storage）](https://www.volcengine.com/docs/6349/74820).

## Features

* Excellent read/write performance (optimized by multi-threading and multi-disk staging).
* Solid stability (fine-grained judgment on response codes for TOS services).
* Outstanding compatibility (cross-validation completed on the version matrix of four Python versions and two fsspec versions).
* TOS HNS (Hierarchical NameSpace) Bucket support (in adaptation and verification).
* Native [append API](https://www.volcengine.com/docs/6349/74863) support.

## Installation

You can install tosfs via [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/) from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/):

```shell
$ pip install tosfs
```

## Quick Start

### Init FileSystem

* Init via `ak/sk`

```python
from tosfs.core import TosFileSystem

tosfs = TosFileSystem(
    key='ak',
    secret='sk',
    endpoint_url='http://tos-cn-beijing.volces.com',
    region='cn-beijing',
)
```

* Init via system env

make sure these envs take effect:

```shell
export TOS_ACCESS_KEY=' your ak here '
export TOS_SECRET_KEY=' your sk here '
export TOS_ENDPOINT='http://tos-cn-beijing.volces.com'
export TOS_REGION='cn-beijing'
```
then init `TosFileSystem` by setting `credentials_provider` to `EnvCredentialsProvider`

```python
import os
from tosfs.core import TosFileSystem
from tos import EnvCredentialsProvider

tosfs = TosFileSystem(
    endpoint_url=os.environ.get("TOS_ENDPOINT"),
    region=os.environ.get("TOS_REGION"),
    credentials_provider=EnvCredentialsProvider, # must
)
```

### Access FS and file operation APIs

After getting the instance of `TosFileSystem` by following the above guidance,
now we can access fs and file operation apis, e.g.

```python
# list
tosfs.ls("")
tosfs.ls("mybucket", detail=False)
tosfs.ls("mybucket/rootpath/", detail=False)

# file read/write
with tosfs.open('bucket/root/text.txt', mode='wb') as f:
    f.write('hello tosfs!')
    
with tosfs.open('bucket/root/text.txt', mode='rb') as f:
    content = f.read()
    print(content)
```

### integration usages

For more usage in ray, pyspark, pytorch and so on, please refer to the [examples](https://github.com/volcengine/tosfs/tree/main/examples) dir.
