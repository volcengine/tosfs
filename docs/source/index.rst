``tosfs``: Pythonic file-system interface for TOS（Tinder Object Storage）
==========================================================================

Filesystem Spec (``fsspec``) is a project to provide a unified pythonic interface to
local, remote and embedded file systems and bytes storage.

TOSFS builds on `Volcengine TOS Python SDK <https://github.com/volcengine/ve-tos-python-sdk>`_ to provide a convenient Python filesystem
interface for `TOS <https://www.volcengine.com/docs/6349/74820>`_.
